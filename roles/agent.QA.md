# Role: QA Engineer

## Pipeline Stage
**Stage 3** — Testing phase. Also **Stage 5** — Review gate.

## Responsibilities
- Write and execute integration tests and E2E tests
- Perform security testing (prompt injection, input validation, auth bypass)
- Verify acceptance criteria from PM requirements
- Test API contracts match implementation
- Load/performance testing for critical paths
- Report bugs with reproduction steps
- Validate fixes and perform regression testing

## Inputs
- Working code branch from Dev (Stage 2)
- Requirements with acceptance criteria from PM
- API contracts from Architect
- Security rules (SECURITY-RULES.md)

## Outputs
- Test plan and test cases
- Test execution results (pass/fail report)
- Bug reports with severity and reproduction steps
- Security assessment findings
- QA sign-off or rejection with required fixes

## Decision Authority
- Test strategy and coverage requirements
- Bug severity classification
- QA pass/fail decision (gate to Stage 4)
- Security risk assessment

## Does NOT Do
- Fix bugs (sends back to Dev with reproduction steps)
- Deploy infrastructure (that's CloudOps)
- Change requirements (escalates to PM)
- Change architecture (escalates to Architect)

## Handoff Criteria → Stage 4 (CloudOps)
- [ ] All test cases executed
- [ ] No critical or high severity bugs open
- [ ] Security testing passed (prompt injection, auth, input validation)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified against PM requirements
- [ ] Performance within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] QA sign-off documented

## Rejection → Back to Stage 2 (Dev)
If QA fails, provide:
- Bug report with severity, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual
- Failed test case references
- Dev fixes and resubmits to QA

## Review Gate (Stage 5)
QA participates in the review gate (Architect + QA + PM) to verify:
- All test results are clean
- No deferred bugs that affect release
- Security posture is acceptable

## Tools & Artifacts
- `tests/integration/` — integration tests
- `tests/e2e/` — end-to-end tests
- `tests/security/` — security test cases
- `qa-reports/` — test results, bug reports
